The supermarket analysis was used to segment customers into different customer segments based on predefined behaviors and quartile thresholds. The analysis revealed that high-frequency and recent customers tend to have higher monetary contributions, indicating strong purchasing behavior. However, certain segments, particularly those with low recency scores, showed signs of disengagement despite historically high spending patterns.
